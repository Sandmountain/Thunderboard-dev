#### This is the main repo for development of Thunderboard. Another [repo](https://github.com/Sandmountain/thunderboard) is used for deployment.

## Thunderboard
Thunderboard is a utility dashboard that combines your favourite internet apps into one place. The development started out as a Chrome Extension, but because some of the APIs used in the project didn't allow communication through an extension, the project took a turn and became a stand-alone React app.

There are currently 2 different modes the apps can use, either the customizable grid- or the minimalist view. And currently supports apps with integrations such as:  
  - Reddit
  - Twitch
  - G-mail
  - G-calender
  - Youtube
  - RSS via Aftonbladet (Swedish newspaper)
